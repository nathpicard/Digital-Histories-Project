# Digital-Humanities-Project
Chinatown Projection Mapping

**The Idea**

Twelve Chinese businesses established in the early 20th century between Kent and O'Connor on Albert Street, no longer present. 

Let's bring them back to life

**How**

-Find photos and locations of the businesses in the Ottawa archives, as well as information about them.

-Get in contact with the current Ottawa Chinese Association to get their support for the project.

-A website like Shawn showed us that gives information about each one of these businesses.

-Use QR codes on each projected building so that people can open the website to learn more about each business.

-Evening projections for people to learn about the *unknown history* of those blocks.
